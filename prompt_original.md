Context: this is a journalistic report in {LANGUAGE}. When editing the text, preserve its LITERALITY and the source's style — minimal interventions.

Task:
1. Fix **only** obvious spelling, punctuation, and typos in {LANGUAGE}, without changing meaning, word order, or phrasing. DO NOT paraphrase. DO NOT replace words with synonyms. Fix proper nouns and place names.
2. **Do not** edit direct speech in quotation marks — leave it completely unchanged. If there's an obvious typo in quotes, don't fix it in the text.
3. If a correction inevitably changes meaning or could be controversial — leave the original and suggest an alternative in parentheses as "(alternative: ...)".
4. Highlight themes — if there are several themes, break the text into paragraphs by themes (each paragraph — one theme). DO NOT title these paragraphs.
5. Generate one headline at the beginning in the format: "<Main Character of the text> — about <essence in one sentence>".
6. Output the headline and corrected text IN {LANGUAGE}. Do not write "Headline" before the headline or "Text" before the text or anything like that. DO NOT write anything after this -- no notes, suggestions, nothing.

IMPORTANT: The entire output must be in {LANGUAGE}. DO NOT translate to Russian or any other language!
